# 🏙️ Bengaluru House Price Prediction App

This project is a **Machine Learning-powered web application** that predicts house prices in Bengaluru, India, based on inputs like square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and location.

The app uses a **Linear Regression model** built with Python and Scikit-Learn, integrated into a modern web interface using **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and deployed using **Nginx** on an **AWS EC2 instance**.
